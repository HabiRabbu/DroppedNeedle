"""Pluggable download-client contract.

Stable boundary between ``services/native`` and any concrete download client.
The orchestrator, matcher, and file processor import only this module's
protocol types, never ``repositories/slskd``.

Does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations``: the conformance contract
test compares ``inspect.signature`` of the protocol methods against each
implementation, so annotations here and in every implementation must be real
objects (not strings) and identical.
