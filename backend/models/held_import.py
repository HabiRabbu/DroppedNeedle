"""HeldImport - a downloaded file that matched a track but failed the AcoustID
recording-identity check, copied aside for a human "import anyway" / "discard"
decision. The download-side counterpart to the scan's manual_review_queue: here the
target track IS known (we matched it by duration), only the identity backstop
disagreed - usually because MusicBrainz's crowd metadata for that recording is wrong."""
