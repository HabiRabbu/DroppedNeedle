"""The ordered spec pipeline.

``run`` applies the shared specs in order and returns the FIRST ``Reject``, else
``Accept``. Both scorers call this before computing their source-specific ranking
signals (blueprint step 1), so the shared identity/quality/blocklist decisions can
never drift between Soulseek and Usenet.

Order is Lidarr-style: blocklist → identity → quality (cheapest, most-decisive
first). Source-specific gates that aren't shared yet (Soulseek codec/no-audio,
Usenet password/edition/size/video) still live in their scorers and move to specs
in step 2.
