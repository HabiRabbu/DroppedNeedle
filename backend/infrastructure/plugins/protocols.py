"""Capability protocols - what a plugin implements, and what the host hands it.

A plugin's entrypoint class is instantiated once as ``Entry(context)`` and may
implement any subset of the capability methods matching its manifest. All
methods are async and best-effort: an exception is logged against the plugin
and never propagates into the host flow that triggered it.

**No capability here acquires content, and the host never calls plugin code to
acquire** (D22). Do not add one. A capability that searches a source and fetches
its files is a downloader-shaped socket, whatever it is named: DroppedNeedle's
own UI would present the results and DroppedNeedle's own process would perform
the fetch, and no plugin boundary launders that. It would also defeat Free
Music's licence filter, since fetched bytes arrive with no licence attached. A
third party who wants their own source uses the public REST API (``GET
/requests`` as a wishlist, ``POST /import/uploads`` as an inbox), which DN never
calls, or forks the AGPL project. See `.dev-notes/Legality/Roadmap.md`.
